In this project I developed a Machine Learning Model for Space Y, a fictional willing to compete against SpaceX;
The goal of model is to predict when Stage 1 will successfully land to save ~$100 million USD;
Used data from a public SpaceX API and web scraping SpaceX Wikipedia page;
Created data labels and stored data into a DB2 SQL database;
Created a dashboard for visualization;
We created a machine learning model with an accuracy of 83%;
Allon Mask of SpaceY can use this model to predict with relatively high accuracy whether a  launch will have a successful Stage 1 landing before launch to determine whether the launch  should be made or not;
If possible more data should be collected to better determine the best machine learning model and improve accuracy.
